# 🕶️ Blind Auction – Python CLI Game

Welcome to the **Blind Auction** – a fun and simple command-line program written in Python where users can secretly place their bids. The highest bidder wins, but no one knows what others have bid until the very end!

## 🎯 What It Does

- Accepts up to 3 users (or more if you modify it)
- Each user enters their name and bid
- Clears the screen after each input to keep bids hidden
- Announces the winner with the highest bid at the end

## 🛠️ Features

- Uses Python dictionaries to store user bids
- Includes screen-clearing functionality for better UI
- Dynamic handling of multiple users
- Identifies and displays the highest bidder

## 🖥️ Sample Output

Enter your name please:

alice Enter alice's bid in $: 150 Is there another user who wants to bid? (yes/no): yes

Enter your name please:

bob Enter bob's bid in $: 200 Is there another user who wants to bid? (yes/no): no

The winner is bob with a bid of $200!
